<h2>Beginnings</h2>
    <p>Unlike Mary Karr's <cite>The Liars' Club</cite>, Walls begins her memoir with a memory from her adulthood. She is in New York City, 
        riding in a taxi, when she gut-wrenchingly recognizes her mother in the face of a homeless woman on the street. Instead of reaching out 
        to her mother, she slinks down in her seat and directs the taxi driver off in the opposite direction. Although she later invites
        her mother to lunch and they speak about this incident openly, this introduction reeks of the guilt and shame that Walls feels about 
        her family.</p>
    <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
        <cite>The Glass Castle</cite> tells the story of Jeannette Walls' tumultuous childhood, moving from town to town with her eclectic family. 
        Her father, is constantly uprooting his family to do <q>the skedaddle</q>. Oftentimes, this uprooting is due to evading the law.The book opens with Jeannette's father breaking her out of the hospital without permission from staff or doctors. This hospital
        visit is prefaced with a disturbing account of Jeannette receiving third-degree burns while trying to make hot dogs (at age 3). This first
        snippet of Walls' life serves to set up the high degree of independence that was fostered in her home. Her father, in particular, 
        values utility above all else. </p>
