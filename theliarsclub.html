<h2>Beginnings</h2>
    <p>
         Arguably, the beginning of a book is important for catching the attention of readers. Not only does Karr acheive this in her shocking 
        introduction, but the rhetorical moves that are set in motion by this intro are hugely important to the memoir as a whole.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
        <cite>The Liars' Club</cite> is a story that discusses the complex family dynamics, set in the East Texas town of Leechfield. 
        The memoir begins by citing Karr's most prominent memory from her childhood, where she is being asked by the family doctor to <cite>
        show [him] the marks</cite>. We as readers later learn that her mother has been taken away for being 'Nervous', and we can draw
        the conclusion that her mother is the cause of the doctor's concerns about Mary, although she makes it clear that she was not 
        physically harmed by her mother in this occurrence. </p>
<h2 class="parents">Father Figures & Family</h2>
        <p>Karr basically idolizes her father the entirety of her childhood, a fact supported by the many instances in which Karr 
                speaks fondly of him and his tenderness towards her. 
        <blockquote>With Daddy and his friends, I always knew what would happen and that left me feeling a sort of dreamy safety.</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>Karr's closeness with her father may be explained by the fact that her mother was not emotionally or physically all that present
            during her childhood. After the incident with the doctor, as mentioned above, her mother is institutionalized for a time. Additionally, 
            while <cite>The Glass Castle</cite> does not really mention extended family members until about the halfway point, <cite>The Liars' Club</cite>
            tackles the complex and messy family dynamics that include Karr's grandmother. Karr sees how her own mother chafes under the pressure of 
            her mother being around her family. Sadly, Karr's grandmother is also dying of cancer, the treatment of which addles her mind and further
            demonizes her in Karr's eyes. At the time, mustard gas was used to try and stop the spread of melanoma in the elderly woman's leg, 
            but it ended up being amputated. After visiting her dying mother in the hospital, Karr's mother is emotionally absent, with
            Karr likening her to the <q>dull-coated panther</q> at the zoo. Karr quotes the German poet Rilke, who wrote;
        <blockquote>It seems there are/ a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world./ As he paces in cramped circles, over and over /
            the movement of his powerful soft strides/ is like a ritual dance around a center/ in which a might will stands paralyzed.
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>What I found most interesting as I have compared these two memoirs is that both Karr and Walls make mention of 
                <blockquote>With Mother, I always felt on edge of something new, something never before seen or read about or bought, something
                that would change us. When you climbed in the car with her, you never knew where you'd end up.
                </blockquote>
