        <p> Hi, my name is Jessica Davis and I am an aspiring Technical Writer and current English Literature Student at George Mason University.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always been a huge reader, starting as far back as I can remember. Prior to last semester, I would say that my favorite
            genre was historical fiction. However, in Spring 2024, I took a class called Writing Nonfiction for the Public (ENGH 486) at
            George Mason University. In that class, I learned that the term <strong>"nonfiction"</strong> is much more flexible and complex
            than at first blush. A person can be as committed as they want to be regarding their memory of events, but long term memory becomes
            less and less reliable over time. Therefore, necessarily, there is a degree of distortion of these facts. But does this make a story
            fictional, or any less nonfictional? In ENGH 486, I learned that there are different defintions of what truth is. Something that is true 
            to me, like a moral or belief, may not be true to you, or anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>On the following pages, I hope to give you some insight into the complexities that reside within these two great memoirs, 
            <cite>The Liars' Club</cite> and <cite>The Glass Castle</cite>. These books contain similarities that I find extremely interesting, 
            particularly in regards to how the authors characterize their parents and families. These two authors are expert craftswomen when it
            comes to storytelling, and their stories are certainly worth reading. As you may see, particularly if you read either or both of these memoirs, 
            they certainly have a family history in storytelling. I hope that this site gives you an insightful introduction into these memoirs
            and that the snippets you read are enticing to your mind enough to give these books a read.</p>
