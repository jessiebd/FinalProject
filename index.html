        <p> Hi, my name is Jessica Davis and I am an aspiring Technical Writer and current English Literature Student at George Mason University.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always been a huge reader, starting as far back as I can remember. Prior to last semester, I would say that my favorite
            genre was historical fiction. However, in Spring 2024, I took a class called Writing Nonfiction for the Public (ENGH 486) at
            George Mason University. In that class, I learned that the term <strong>"nonfiction"</strong> is much more flexible and complex
            than at first blush. A person can be as committed as they want to be regarding their memory of events, but long term memory becomes
            less and less reliable over time. Therefore, necessarily, there is a degree of distortion of these facts. But does this make a story
            fictional, or any less nonfictional? In ENGH 486, I learned that there are different defintions of what truth is. Something that is true 
            to me, like a moral or belief, may not be true to you, or anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>I am fascinated by memoirs because they are so detailed, and, in the case of <cite>The Glass Castle</cite> and <cite>The Liars' Club</cite>
        beautifully written. The stories are engaging and the prose is engaging.
